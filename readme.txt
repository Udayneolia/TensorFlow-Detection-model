How to Run TensorFlow Lite Models on Windows------


Step 1. Download and Install Anaconda.
>>First, install Anaconda, which is a Python environment manager that greatly simplifies Python package management and deployment. Anaconda allows you to create Python virtual environments on your PC without interfering with existing installations of Python.


Step 2. Set Up Virtual Environment and Directory.
>> 2.1 >>Go to the Start Menu, search for "Anaconda Command Prompt", and click it to open up a command terminal. We'll create a folder called tflite1 directly in the C: drive.  Create the folder and move into it by issuing the following commands in the terminal:	

mkdir C:\tflite
cd C:\tflite	
           		
>> 2.2 >>Create a Python 3.9 virtual environment by issuing:

conda create --name tflite-env python=3.9  
enter "y" when it asks if you want to proceed.

>> 2.3 >>Install the required packages by issuing the commands below. We'll install TensorFlow, OpenCV, and a downgraded version of protobuf.

conda activate tflite-env	
pip install tensorflow opencv-python protobuf==3.20.*

Step 3. Move TFLite Model into Directory.
>>Next, take the custom TFLite model that was trained and downloaded from the Colab notebook and move it into the C:\tflite directory.


Step 4. Run TensorFlow Lite Model!
>>Just call one of the detection scripts and point it at your model folder with the --modeldir option. For example, to run your custom_model_lite model on a webcam, issue:

python webcam.py --modeldir=custom_model_lite
